# Challenge 6 World Weather Analysis

# Overview:

-Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
-Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
-Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

## Deliverable 1:

Create 2000 random latitude-longitude pairs and then find the closest city to those points. After that I found the weather data for those cities and placed them into a 
DataFrame.

## Deliverable 2:

Using the data from deliverable 1, I found hotels in each of the cities based on the user's input of minimum and maximum temperature and placed this information into one DataFrame.

## Deliverable 3:

Using the data from deliverable 2, I picked 4 cities in one country and then using gmaps functions I created a travel route between the 4 cities.
